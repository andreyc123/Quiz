It’s a demo project. I’ve written it just to study Apple’s SwiftUI framework. This application can be used to test knowledge of students. It requires authorization using email and password and uses Firebase Realtime Database as a backend.

The app consists of the following screens:

* Log in
* Sign up
* Forgot password
* Profile
* List of topics
* Test screen
* Screen with results

As for now, my database contains only 2 topics. I used some material from https://www.engvid.com/ to add them.
